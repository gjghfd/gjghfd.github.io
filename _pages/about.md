I am a Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science at Peking University, co-advised by Prof. [Hong Mei](https://faculty.pku.edu.cn/meih/) and Prof. [Xin Jin](https://xinjin.github.io/).

I received my B.S. degree in computer science from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2023.

My research interests include machine learning systems, distributed systems, and serverless computing.
